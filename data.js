        text: `A relaxed yet high-octane cinematic shot of a man riding a vintage customized classic cafe racer motorcycle through a sprawling, sun-drenched neo-cyberpunk ruin.\n\nThe rider exudes a "casual-cool" vibe, wearing a modish cyberpunk casual outfit: a weathered oversized denim jacket over a technical charcoal hoodie, distressed dark cargo joggers with tactical straps, and fingerless leather gloves.\n\nHis posture is relaxed but focused, one hand confidently on the throttle as he navigates through the desolate city.\n\nEnvironment & Atmosphere:\nA bright, post-apocalyptic urban wasteland under a vast, hazy sky. Skeletal mega-skyscrapers overgrown with digital moss and rusted steel rebar.\n\nTechnical Settings:\nShot on Hasselblad X1D II, 50mm lens at f/1.8. 8K quality, Golden Ratio composition.\n\nReference Face Integration:\nUse provided photo reference. Facial features 100% identical.`

        text: `Using the provided photo reference, keep the exact shape, structure, and layout of the vegetable seller rack as seen in the original image:\n\na large rectangular wooden-and-metal rack, multi-level shelves, open wire mesh sides, with plastic bags of vegetables hanging on the sides and rear. Do not redesign the rack shape — maintain its authentic Indonesian mobile vegetable seller form.\n\nTransform the motorcycle itself into a modern sport motorcycle, fully faired, aggressive and aerodynamic, finished in glossy pink color that harmonizes with the overall look.\n\nThe original vegetable rack is carefully modified only at the mounting points, reinforced with custom brackets so it can be securely attached to the rear subframe of a sport bike, without changing the rack’s proportions or visual identity.\n\nThe motorcycle is stationary, stopped on a small Indonesian neighborhood street.\n\nA man is seated on the motorcycle, using the photo reference for body position and scale.\n\nA pink sport helmet is placed on top of the fuel tank, resting naturally with realistic contact shadows.\n\nThe man is holding a smartphone, looking at the screen as if reading a message.\n\nHe is wearing a full Power Ranger Pink costume (helmet off) — iconic pink suit with white diamond pattern, gloves, and boots, clean and vibrant.\n\nThe rack is filled exactly like the reference: spinach, kangkung, sawi, chilies (red and green), tomatoes, onions, herbs, and groceries, stored in shelves and transparent plastic bags hanging on the sides, maintaining the same visual density and randomness as a real Indonesian vegetable seller.\n\nStrong visual contrast between:\n– modern pink sport motorcycle\n– traditional Indonesian vegetable rack unchanged in shape\n– Power Ranger Pink costume\n\nUltra-realistic, natural daylight, sharp textures, cinematic depth of field, grounded Indonesian street atmosphere.`

        text: `Ultra-realistic cinematic macro–medium shot of a flat open-air PC case placed on an elegant, clean work desk. The flagship motherboard is mounted horizontally, fully exposed in a low-profile open-air layout.At the exact center sits a brain-shaped processor, hyper-realistic human brain form with deep neural folds, organic matte surface, subtle veins, and natural flesh tones — no glow, no internal light, completely unpowered.Several transparent liquid-cooling tubes are connected directly into the brain processor through clean bio-mechanical connectors embedded naturally between folds. The tubes contain clear, colorless coolant, fully static, with no ARGB, no illumination, no movement, no reflections from LEDs.All PC components are powered off:– No RGB or indicator lights– No illuminated RAM or GPU– Monitor screen completely black and off– No reflections from active displaysSurrounding the processor are high-end RAM modules, GPU, and premium motherboard circuitry, all visible in dark metallic finishes, softly blurred to maintain focus on the brain CPU. Cable management is clean and precise.A man assembling the PC is visible from the side or top-down angle, hands carefully adjusting components near the processor. If his face appears, use photo reference for exact facial accuracy (do not alter eyes, nose, lips, jaw, or hairstyle). He wears a plain white casual t-shirt.Lighting is purely studio and environmental, soft diffused light from above and side, realistic shadows defining depth and texture, no artificial tech glow.Camera angle: slightly elevated top-down three-quarter view, macro lens look (85–100mm), shallow depth of field emphasizing the processor and cooling tubes.Ultra-photorealistic, extreme material accuracy, professional studio photography, clean futuristic-minimal aesthetic, 8K detail.`
